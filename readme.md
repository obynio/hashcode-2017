## Synopsis

**hashcode_2017** is our submission for the [Google Hash Code](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/) challenge that took place in February 2017. Hash Code is a team-based programming competition organized by Google for students and industry professionals.

## About the project

Given a dataset about cache servers, network endpoints and videos, we had to code an algorithm to optimize the copy of popular videos into cache servers in order to minimize the average waiting time of endpoints requests. We had about 3 hours to code the best algorithm possible and submit our work to the Judge System. 

This challenge was a quite close to a real-life engineering problem, pretty much like YouTube. You can take a look at the subject [right here](https://pool.sybiload.com/git/hashcode_2017/hashcode_2017_subject.pdf). It was damn good challenge, we had a great moment and a honnest score of 723 999 points ;)
